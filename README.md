Samsung "NASA" RS485 handling

## Required Hardware

Samsung NASA-Devices connected to a Waveshare RS485-Ethernet gateway.
This library has been tested with Samsung AC-NASA Devices but should work
also with heatpumps and all other devices connected by RS485.

It's been tested with connection to F1/F2 and not with R1/R2.

See Wiki for required installation-steps
